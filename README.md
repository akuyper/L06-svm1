# SVM Lab I (L06)

Download the repository as a zip folder and begin an R project for this lab. The zip folder will contain instructions (repeated below) and a template to get an Rmd file started.

# Overview

There are two goals for this lab. The first is to continue practicing both the implementation of a consistent and organized style-guide and implementation of `tidyverse` coding enhancements to the base R code provided in the book. The second is to practice the application of classifiers generally calls support vector machines (SVM).

# Datasets 

We will be utilizing the `Khan` datasets (*khan_xtrain.csv*, *khan_ytrain.csv*, *khan_xtest.csv*, and *khan_ytest.csv*) which are all contained in the **data** subdirectory. Students are able to access the appropriate codebook by using `?ISLR::Khan`.

# Exercise

Please complete the following exercise. The submitted documents should be neatly formatted. 

#### Exercise 1
Work through the entire lab in Section 9.6 *Lab: Support Vector Machines* (pages: 359 - 368) while attempting to utilize `tidyverse` techniques when possible. 

Please note that *"attempting to utilize `tidyvere` techniques when possible"* entails that students make an **honest** effort to implement these techniques. Copying, pasting, running, and submitting the code provided in the book does not constitute an **honest** effort. 

While it might feel redundant to re-create code in a slightly different format, it is an extremely useful skill to practice. It is only really redundant because base R code is supplied. The base R code provides a good starting point for us to build upon and improve it by converting it to a more flexible and organized format. Students should also consider adding their own notes and commentary to make this lab into a useful resource for the future.
